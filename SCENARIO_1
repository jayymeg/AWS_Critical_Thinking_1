**SCENARIO 1**

As a senior DevOps engineer, you are tasked with designing a solution to ensure users in two different geographical locations, India and London, have a good browsing experience with minimal latency. Create an infrastructure solution that optimizes performance and minimizes latency for users in both regions. Consider factors such as content delivery networks (CDNs), edge caching, global load balancing, and region-specific deployment strategies to achieve this goal effectively. After designing the solutions (use draw.io), implement them and create the infrastructure in your AWS console.

**SERVERLESS SOLUTION**

**STEP 1:**

Prepare the application; create a basic HTML file for your static website. (index.html)

**STEP 2:**

Host the static website on Amazon S3

- Create an S3 bucket

Chose the region closest to users in INDIA & LONDON (Europe (Frankfurt) eu-central-1)

- Upload the website files;

Upload the index.html file to the S3 bucket

- Enable static website hosting
- Make the bucket public

**STEP 3:**

Set up Amazon CloudFront

- Create a CloudFront Distribution

Set the Origin Domain Name to the “S3 bucket’s website endpoint”

- Latency Optimization

CloudFront automatically uses edge locations closest to users for low latency.

Users in INDIA will use nearby edge location while those in LONDON will use European edge locations.

**STEP 4:**

Configure DNS with Route 53

- Create a Hosted Zone; (Navigate to Route 53) for your domain
- Add DNS Records:

Create a CNAME Record pointing to the CloudFront domain name

Use Latency Routing Policy to optimize user experience for INDIA and LONDON

**STEP 5:**

Monitor and Optimize

- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor latency and request patterns.

**BENEFITS OF THIS SERVERLESS SOLUTION**

- Scalable: Automatically handles any traffic load.
- Low maintenance: no servers to manage.
- Cost-Effective: pay only for what you use.
- High performance: uses ‘CloudFront’ global edge network.

This approach is simple, fully serverless, and ideal for minimizing latency across regions.
